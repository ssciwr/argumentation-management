The
Scientific
Software
Center
strives
to
improve
scientific
software
development
to
ensure
reproducible
science
and
software
sustainability
.
The
SSC
also
acts
as
a
link
between
the
different
scientific
disciplines
,
enabling
collaboration
and
interdisciplinary
research.The
current
role
of
software
in
research
communitiesSoftware
development
is
an
increasingly
vital
part
of
research
,
but
if
not
done
sustainably
the
result
is
often
unmaintainable
software
and
irreproducible
science
.
This
is
due
to
a
lack
of
software
engineering
training
for
scientists
,
limited
funding
for
maintaining
existing
software
and
few
permanent
software
developer
positions.The
SSC
addresses
the
current
shortcomings
by
implementing
the
three
pillars
of
Development
,
Teaching
and
Outreach
.
