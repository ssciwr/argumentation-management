    "# The input\n",
    "The input for the package would normally be set up in an input.json file passed to the package.  There are two example .json files in this directory which we will use. Lets look at the contents of example_en.json. The first few parameters we encounter are:\n",

    "```\n",
    "These tell the programm that the data we want to annotate is stored in example_en.txt, that we want to output to a file which we can identify as output_en and that we want to use the tool spacy to annotate the data. There will be more tools to chose from, but for simplicity their configurations have been stripped for now. The spacy specific config is found in the `\"spacy_dict\"` section. Here we find the parameters we can tell spacy to enable it to annotate the data. The entries do usually come with a comment explaining what the parameters do. Lets look through the ones we set up in example_en.json:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \"model\": false,\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we can specify a model spacy should use to annotate the text if we want to. We leave it to false for now though.\n",

    "    \"lang\": \"en\",\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we specify that the language of the data we want to annotate is english. Since we didn't specify a model this information will be needed to chose one for us.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \"text_type\": \"news\",\n",
    "```\n",
    "We specify what kind of text we want to annotate in order to chose an appropriate model for the task. This does currently only support \"news\" for english. The setup we chose here will lead to the usage of the model en_core_web_md.\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \"processors\": \"senter, tagger, parser, attribute_ruler, lemmatizer, ner\",\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we specifiy the processors for the pipeline we will apply to our data. This will define what kind of annotations we get in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining entries are not immediatly important for this example and are all set to their default values. Especially the `\"config\"` parameter and its contents are usually defined for a given model in it's config.cfg file and should not be tempered with."
