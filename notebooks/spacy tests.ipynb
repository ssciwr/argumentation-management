      "As part of the product upgrade at the end of twenty thirteen , the Audi A eight gained a number of new features relating to driver assist systems . These new features are the topic of this service T-V programme . We will be looking at the following driver assist systems : Audi Audi active Lane assist , Audi park assist , Audi night vision assist , and the head up display . The changeover from hydraulical steering to electromechanical steering now means that it is possible to offer Audi active lane assist in the Audi A eight as well . Due to the planned steering interventions , this system requires electromechanical steering . Until the product upgrade took place on the Audi A eight , only Audi lane assist was offered on this model , but not the version that actively intervenes in the steering . This version has been available for some time now on the Audi A six and Audi A seven model . Audi active lane assist , which is now available in the Audi A eight , is very similar to the system in the Audi A six and A seven . However , one innovative new feature has been added . If both Audi side assist , the lane change assist , as well as Audi active lane assist , are present in the Audi A eight , then these two assist systems exchange data . Doing so enables the following system optimisation . To date , if the driver changed lane and set a direction indicator while Audi active lane assist was activated , the output of a warning would have been suppressed . It was assumed that the change of lane was intentional . In the new system , this warning is also normally suppressed , but with one exception . If Audi side assist detects an approaching vehicle in the neighbouring lane , a warning is given despite the direction indicator having been set . The warning is given by means of a steering intervention , and , if this is activated in the M-M-I , via a vibration in the steering wheel . As a result , the driver is made aware that changing lane at the present time could lead to an accident . If you would like to learn more about Audi active lane assist , take a look at self-study program four eight three . This booklet describes the technology and functions of the system in detail . Electromechanical steering not only enables active steering intervention in lane assist systems . In future , the driver will also be assisted when driving into parking spaces in the A eight if required . With the introduction of Audi park assist in the Audi A eight , the semiautomated parking system can also be ordered for this class of vehicle . The system has been taken from the Audi A six and A seven , although one major parameter had to be adapted . When parallel parking , the customer will only be told that a parking space is sufficiently long if it is at least the length of the vehicle plus one metre . Audi park assist determines the length of the space using ultrasonic sensors fitted to the side of the vehicle . If you would like to read more about the technology used in Audi park assist , we recommend that you take a look at self-study program six hundred . Audi new driver assist systems in twenty eleven . The driver is offered real added value , even in the dark . Audi night vision assist now boasts a major new function following the Audi A eight product upgrade . To date , night vision assist only detected pedestrians using a thermal imaging camera and highlighted them with yellow brackets . If the system detected a risk of collision with a pedestrian , the system would output a graphic and an acoustic warning . Following the product upgrade , the night vision assist in the Audi A eight now also detects large wild animals and highlights these in the thermal image displayed . The system warns the driver if there is a likelihood of an imminent collision with a wild animal . As a result , the system is able to contribute further to supporting the driver in avoiding accidents . Anyone wishing to find out more information about Audi night vision assist can take a look at self-study program four six two . Audi A eight ten , night vision assist . The head-up display resulting from the Audi A eight product upgrade is mainly based on the head up display in the Audi C seven . Only a few details have been modified . The displays are the same , apart from one exception . The combined display of adaptive cruise control and Audi active lane assist has been removed . Instead , a red warning symbol for the distance and collision warning system is projected onto the windscreen . The procedure for calibrating the head up display in customer service has remained the same as for the Audi A six and A seven . If you wish to learn more about the head up display , please take a look at self-study program four eight two . Audi A seven Sportback , head-up display and speed limit indicator . Anything you need to know about this system is described in this booklet . We always want to improve our programmes . Please send any suggestions , improvements and topic requests you may have to Audi dot service dot T-V at Audi dot D-E . \n"

      "As part of the product upgrade at the end of twenty thirteen , the Audi A eight gained a number of new features relating to driver assist systems .\n",
      "***\n",
      "These new features are the topic of this service T-V programme .\n",
      "***\n",
      "We will be looking at the following driver assist systems : Audi Audi active Lane assist , Audi park assist , Audi night vision assist , and the head up display .\n",
      "***\n",
      "The changeover from hydraulical steering to electromechanical steering now means that it is possible to offer Audi active lane assist in the Audi A eight as well .\n",
      "***\n",
      "Due to the planned steering interventions , this system requires electromechanical steering .\n",
      "***\n",
      "Until the product upgrade took place on the Audi A eight , only Audi lane assist was offered on this model , but not the version that actively intervenes in the steering .\n",
      "***\n",
      "This version has been available for some time now on the Audi A six and Audi A seven model .\n",
      "***\n",
      "Audi active lane assist , which is now available in the Audi A eight , is very similar to the system in the Audi A six and A seven .\n",
      "***\n",
      "However , one innovative new feature has been added .\n",
      "***\n",
      "If both Audi side assist , the lane change assist , as well as Audi active lane assist , are present in the Audi A eight , then these two assist systems exchange data .\n",
      "***\n",
      "Doing so enables the following system optimisation .\n",
      "***\n",
      "To date , if the driver changed lane and set a direction indicator while Audi active lane assist was activated , the output of a warning would have been suppressed .\n",
      "***\n",
      "It was assumed that the change of lane was intentional .\n",
      "***\n",
      "In the new system , this warning is also normally suppressed , but with one exception .\n",
      "***\n",
      "If Audi side assist detects an approaching vehicle in the neighbouring lane , a warning is given despite the direction indicator having been set .\n",
      "***\n",
      "The warning is given by means of a steering intervention , and , if this is activated in the M-M-I , via a vibration in the steering wheel .\n",
      "***\n",
      "As a result , the driver is made aware that changing lane at the present time could lead to an accident .\n",
      "***\n",
      "If you would like to learn more about Audi active lane assist , take a look at self-study program four eight three .\n",
      "***\n",
      "This booklet describes the technology and functions of the system in detail .\n",
      "***\n",
      "Electromechanical steering not only enables active steering intervention in lane assist systems .\n",
      "***\n",
      "In future , the driver will also be assisted when driving into parking spaces in the A eight if required .\n",
      "***\n",
      "With the introduction of Audi park assist in the Audi A eight , the semiautomated parking system can also be ordered for this class of vehicle .\n",
      "***\n",
      "The system has been taken from the Audi A six and A seven , although one major parameter had to be adapted .\n",
      "***\n",
      "When parallel parking , the customer will only be told that a parking space is sufficiently long if it is at least the length of the vehicle plus one metre .\n",

      "***\n",
      "If the system detected a risk of collision with a pedestrian , the system would output a graphic and an acoustic warning .\n",
